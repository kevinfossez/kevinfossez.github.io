## R. Feynman suggestion

- R. Feynman  
  _There's plenty of room at the bottom_  
  Talk at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society at Caltech (1959) [pdf](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/1960Bottom.pdf)

> _When we get to the very, very small world—say circuits of seven atoms—we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc._
